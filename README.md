Hackintosh OpenCore Boot

          RAM           :        16 GB 

    Hard     Drive      :       Western Digital Machanical Disk
                                    
    Display Adapter     :        GTX 1650Ti    (not supported, only 630UHD)

    Network Adapter.    :       BCM94352z Broadcom network adapter

       Audio            :       Realtek (ALC3254)
                                  
WHAT IS WORKING : 
 
1.Display         (Adjust Brightness)
2.Audio           
3.Network     
4.Usb              
5.Backlight Keyboard   
6.SD card         
7.Type C       (Only Charging function , no other tests)
8.TouchPad     ( As original )

WHAT IS NOT WORKING :
1. HDMI           (No response , all black)
2. 3.5mm audio interface   (Noise)
3. Mic            (the intel@smart technology not supported)
 

PS : This folder can only start your hackintosh, not windows, so you need to put your Microsoft boot folder into EFI

Because the bcm94352z network card has been replaced, both "SPACE DELIVERY" and "RELAY" are supported on this machine
